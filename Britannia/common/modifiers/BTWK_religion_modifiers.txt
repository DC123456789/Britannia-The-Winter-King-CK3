#ANGLO-SAXON - NOTE: Separated from norse due to issues with localising the modifiers for different relgions. Ideally would have preferred to reuse the same "generic" modifiers to save on space, which changes loc based on religious trigger, but I'm unsure how to do that (or if you can, based on how the Indian religions were segmented).
