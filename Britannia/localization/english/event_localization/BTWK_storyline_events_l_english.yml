The babe's crippled leg - a bad omen - only helps to sow the seeds of discontent. Without sufficient preparation for your death - #italic and#! Mordred's premature ascension - disaster will surely befall Dumnonia. \n\nAs High King of Britannia, you have the authority to convene 'High Councils' in times of peril. Many years have passed since the last summit, but with the threat ever-increasing encroachment by the Saxons, and British warlords forever infighting, this could be a chance to bring renewed stability.

 BTWK_story_event.0102.desc:0 "A messenger has delivered a letter bearing the seal of Dumnonia. King Uther has arranged for a High Council to be convened in the great hall of Glevum. As you are one of Britain's most powerful warlords, he has requested your attendance. Presence at the meeting offers a great opportunity to heal the old wounds between rival realms, giving chances to forge bonds anew. With the Germanic barbarians amassing their strength within the Lost Lands of Lloegyr, and the frequency of Irish raids increasing yearly, putting an end to the infighting plaguing Britons is of paramount importance.\n\n A missive within the letter particularly sticks out however - Uther intends to seek marriage for his late heir's widow, Princess Norwenna. Any unmarried ruler, or his unmarried heir, is an eligible candidate for this arrangement, and will be oathbound in the protection of the Edling Mordred - the new heir presumptive of Dumnonia - till he is of fit age to rule, effectively forming an alliance with Dumnonia."

However, upon hearing the news, Uther banished his bastard son Arthur to Benoic, blaming the young soldier for his brother's untimely death.\n\n While this arrangement may have proven a boon for the Armorican ruler, the impending council could be the perfect opportunity to petition for Arthur's return. You will leave this task to your trusted Marshal, [GetTitleByKey('c_glevum').GetHolder.GetShortUIName]. Directly announcing your support for the Prince personally will not lend you any favours, least of all with Uther himself.\n\n The High King's hositility aside, no one can deny Arthur is an exceptional man, soldier, and diplomat. Britannia may have capable men ready to fight for their country to the bitter end, history has taught you such people are doomed to oblivion without a skilled leader to match. Maybe Arthur is the answer?"

The young Prince had been banished by none other than Uther himself, his own father, following the death of the High King's only legitimate son and heir's death. Doing so will ensure that Arthur - a brilliant soldier and leader in his own right - may return to the shores of Britannia once more to aid in her struggle against the invading barbarians.\n\n To avoid risking any suspicion, you are to frame the act as the will of your fellow soldiers - easily done, given Arthur's popularity among them.

You let the many lords of Britain in attendance bicker away on who they believe to be the better suitor for Lady Norwenna while you sit in silence, listening. Many a candidate had been suggested, but none were yet to the council's liking. The British kings in Armorica and Hen Ogledd were simply too far from Dumnonia. The remaining fiefdoms in Western Lloegyr, like Stronggore, were half overrun by the Saxons and would certainly be no use in aiding Dumnonia's defence. But then, [agricola_of_glevum.GetShortUIName] spoke the name you dreaded to hear - that of your exiled, bastard son.\n\n 'Arthur', Agricola said. 'I propose Arthur'. \n\n The Dumnonian warriors in the hall rise in applause, but are swiftly quelled as you bring down your spear. Of course, Agricola was acting as King Tewdric's mouthpiece, yet surely Tewdric knew the impossibility of what he asks? While he might be renowned for his martial ability, in your eyes he is nothing but a failed soldier. Why else would he have allowed your late heir, his liege, to die on the battlefield? Furthermore, by having him be wed to Norwenna, you sacrifice any chance you had to secure a new alliance.\n\n While you feel resolute in your decision, you know full well the rejection of your ally's proposition will indebt your to him, and he may make a request of you in the future."
