 # Anglo-Saxon events
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.t: "The [new_duchy_title.GetNameNoTooltip|U]"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.intro: "After seizing control of the region from its former Brythonic owners, the [conqueror.GetCulture.GetName] rulers of [new_duchy_title.Custom('title_region_location')] have created the '[new_duchy_title.GetName]' in the lands they now call their own."
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_hampshire: "Some said it was only a matter of time before the coast of the Solent would fall, threatened by constant Saxon piracy since the 3rd century. In the aftermath of conquest, a large number of Jutish settlers have begun to homestead in the lush woodlands, forming a distinct folkland along the Itchen and Meon rivers.\n\nFrom this day on, the Roman city of Clausentum and the provinces of the Solent coast"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_winchestershire: "The decline of Venta Belgarum can easily be witnessed as infrastructure continues to crumble, and the River Itchen spills into now overgrown fields. Farmsteads and watch-halls are raised here in anticipation of what the conquerors call 'Wintansċīr' becoming a renewed royal center.\n\nFrom this day on, this city, once called Venta by the Romans and the surrounding Belgae heartland"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_somerset: "As the Germanic conquest of Britain has unfolded, the lands of Glastenning were spared by the protective Mendip Hills and the wetlands of the River Parrett. This was not to last. Invading Germanic armies have seized the crown jewel of the Dumnonians, and much of their demoralised elite have chosen to flee aboard countless ships to settle with their kin in Armorica.\n\nFrom this day on, the Roman city of Lindinis and the lands of Glastenning"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_cilternsaete: "The so-called 'Chiltern dwellers,' Britons who eked out a living upon the chalk slopes by grazing their flocks and hunting what the hills would yield, have found themselves subjugated. While some are dispossessed or taken into the service of new lords, many continue to live just as they did before, waxing and waning between their winter and summer pastures as the landscape demands.\n\nFrom this day on, the settlement of Castrum Ecclesiae and the surrounding provinces"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_dorset: "A vital province of Dumnonia has been seized with an immense display of arms. The sheltering downs and the stony strand that once guarded the ships of Roman invaders many centuries ago have opened themselves once more. Deprived of their power base, it seems unlikely that, without an invasion by the Britons of Cambria, the people of Constantine Corneu will reclaim their birthright.\n\nFrom this day on, the lands that once formed the Principality of Durnovaria"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_wiltshire: "Tales tell of a scant band of warriors at Caer Ambra defending as best they could an ancient stone circle to no avail. The barrows, cursus and trackways of these wild lands have become but the newcomers' marching-grounds and highways.\n\nFrom this day on, the great henge by the River Avon and the city of Sorviodunum"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_devon: "What the Britons of Isca lacked in urbanisation, they made up for in their production of tin, ever precious despite the growing preference for iron weaponry. Village by village, the invaders assumed stewardship of the mines while diverting production to fuel the anticipated push westward, to the land's end.\n\nFrom this day on, what remains of the Roman fortress of Isca and the surrounding provinces"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_cornwall: "At the very end of the land, a marker-stone was set, its face turned to sea proclaiming the victory of the Anglo-Saxons. Crossing the countless moorlands to reach this headland was a daunting task when measured against the knowhow of the Cornish warbands, who, owing to many years of war, were isolated and heavily outnumbered.\n\nFrom this day on, the Cornish peninsula, including the stronghold of Tintagel,"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_berkshire: "The Ġewisse, once no more than a band of Saxon mercenaries hired to guard the banks of the upper Thames, have rooted themselves in the land. With the native population subjugated, these lands shall surely serve as a solid base for further expansion.\n\nFrom this day on, a substantial portion of the interior, including the towns of Aelia Castra and Dorcocensis,"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_hwicce: "A great swath of land that rivals the output of Sussex or Kent, the old lands of the Dobunni are dotted by villas and sophisticated Roman farms. The conquest of Glevum, one of the few cities that continued to prosper after the withdrawal of Roman troops, surely comes as a shock to neighbouring princes.\n\nFrom this day on, the cities of Glevum and Corinium, as well as the valley of the River Avon"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_south_angles: "Lactodurum, where the road to Viroconium narrows to ford the River Nene, was once marked by posting-stations and wheelwrights serving an outsized pottery and grain trade. While the rich clay deposits have become a burden through poor drainage and the neglect of ditches, the new conquerors of these lands could easily exploit the resource.\n\nFrom this day on, the towns of Lactodurum and Bannaventa and the surrounding provinces"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_hiccas: "The small town of Durocobrivis, never a prominent sight even at its peak, had long been abandoned by the time the warbands marched through. The new Germanic inhabitants of these lands, the Hiċċe, have settled at what was once the northern extent of the Catuvellauni, adapting these poor soils into grazing lands for their horses.\n\nFrom this day on, the settlement of Durocobrivis and the surrounding provinces"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_middleseaxe: "The jewel of Roman Britannia was once fortified with considerable merit. Despite its gradual abandonment, the name "Londinium" conjures images of splendour among the Britons. Now, the stone curtain and gate-towers barely stand, [conqueror.GetCulture.GetName] sentries pace the battlements and a hastily driven palisade bars Ludgate. Smoke curls over collapsed eaves as workmen prise the remaining bronze from the basilica.\n\nFrom this day on, the city of Londinium, once the chief entrepot of Britannia,"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_mercia: "The lands of the Tame are not particularly attractive, but what they lack in good soil is made up for in coppiced oak and alder for boat-timbers and wattling, peat and bog-iron for smithing, and pannage-rich commons where swine fatten for winter. The Tomsæte, a tribe of exceptional warriors made up of Angle foederati moving ever westward, have seized the opportunity to settle here.\n\nFrom this day on, the settlement of Letocetum and the surrounding provinces"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_middle_angles: "At one point, Ratae served as an imposing vexillation fort, later transforming into the center of a prosperous farming region. Just as with the Corieltauvi before them, a distinct patchwork of independent [conqueror.GetCulture.GetName] tribes have begun to call this land home. It remains to be seen whether the authority of the established tribes will be respected, or whether they will be subsumed under a united kingdom of the Middle Angles.\n\nFrom this day on, the city of Ratae Corieltauvorum and the surrounding provinces"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.fallback: "From this day on, the town of [new_duchy_title.GetPreferredCapital.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] and the surrounding provinces"
