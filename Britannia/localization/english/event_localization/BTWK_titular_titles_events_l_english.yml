 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.t: "[new_duchy_title.GetNameNoTooltip|U]"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.intro: "After seizing control of the region from its former Brythonic owners, the [conqueror.GetCulture.GetName] rulers of [new_duchy_title.Custom('title_region_location')] have created the '[new_duchy_title.GetName]' in the lands they now call their own.\n\n"
  titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_hampshire: "Some said it was only a matter of time before the coast of the Solent would fall, threatened by constant Saxon piracy since the 3rd century. In the aftermath of conquest, a large number of Jutish settlers have begun to homestead in the lush woodlands, forming a distinct folkland along the Itchen and Meon rivers. From this day on, the Roman city of Clausentum and the provinces of the Solent coast"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_winchestershire: "The decline of Venta Belgarum can easily be witnessed as infrastructure continues to crumble, and the River Itchen spills into now overgrown fields. Farmsteads and watch-halls are raised here in anticipation of what the conquerors call 'Wintansċīr' becoming a renewed royal center. From this day on, this city, once called Venta by the Romans, and the surrouding Belgae heartland"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_somerset: "As the Germanic conquest of Britain has unfolded, the lands of Glastening were spared by the protective Mendip Hills and the wetlands that drain into the River Parrett. This was not to last. Invading Germanic armies have seized the crown jewel of the Dumnonians, and much of their demoralised elite have chosen to flee aboard countless ships to settle with their kin in Armorica. From this day on, Roman town of Lindinis and the lands of Glastenning"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_cilternsaete: "The so-called 'Chiltern dwellers,' who eked out a living upon the chalk slopes by grazing their flocks and hunting what the hills would yield, have been driven from their upland holdings and pushed west into the vale. As the Germanic warbands pressed the heights, their leaders set about remaking the land: many households are dispossessed or taken into the service of new lords, some have fled farther west, and others already seem to vanish from the record as their old ways are broken. From this day on, the provinces of Aelia Castra and Magiovinium"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_dorset: "The old heart of Dumnonia has fallen. The sheltering downs and the stony strand that once guarded the ships of Roman invaders many centuries ago have opened themselves once more. Deprived of their power base, it seems unlikely that, without an invasion by the Britons of Cambria, the people of Constantine Corneu will reclaim their birthright.  From this day on, the lands that once formed the Principality of Durnovaria"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_wiltshire: "Tales tell of a scant band of warriors at Caer Ambra defending as best they could an ancient stone circle to no avail. The barrows, cursus and trackways of these wild lands have become but the newcomers' marching-grounds and highways. From this day on, the great henge by the River Avon and the city of Sorviodunum"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_devon: "What the Britons of Isca lacked in urbanization, they made up for in their production of tin, ever precious despite the growing preference for iron weaponry. As the invaders continued their push through the hinterlands, the elders rowed out under moonlight and cast the smiths’ ingots into the Exe, lighting the market-cross as they fled. From this day on, what remains of the Roman fortress of Isca and its surrounding lands"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.d_cornwall: "At the Western headland of the peninusla, a marker-stone was set, its face turned to sea announcing the victory of the Anglo-Saxons. Crossing the countless moorlands to reach this headland was a daunting task when measured against the knowhow of the Cornubian warbands, but alas, they were heavily outnumbered and isolated. The Cornish peninsula, including the stronghold of Trevena,"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.fallback: "From this day on, the town of [new_duchy_title.GetPreferredCapital.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] and the surrounding provinces"
 titular_titles_anglosaxon.0001.desc.outro: "will belong 'de jure' to the newly formed [new_duchy_title.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip].

Most of [GetTitleByKey('e_britannia').GetNameNoTier] now lies under their rule, including most of its greatest cities and richest lands.\n\nWith the post-Roman order on the island now all but dead, the remaining British kingdoms have become increasingly isolated and withdrawn as dreams of pan-British unity give way to more localized concerns.
