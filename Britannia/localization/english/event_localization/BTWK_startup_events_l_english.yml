 BTWK_startup.0001.ambrosius: "Ambrosius Aurelianus is a name that is spoken of in either glowing reverence or bedgruding respect across all of Britannia. First of the Britons and Last of the Romans, the Ambrosii were among the most distinguished Roman families that remained in Britannia after the Roman withdrawal, with father and then son mounting a determined resistance against Vortigern's ill-fated machinations and leading the struggle against the subsequent Saxon onslaught in a concerted effort to protect the British way of life."
