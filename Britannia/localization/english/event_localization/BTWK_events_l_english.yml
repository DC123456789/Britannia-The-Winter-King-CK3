  BTWK_frontier_event.0001_desc:0 "Mercian dominance over the British Midlands is now unquestioned. Having taken full control of the former heartlands of Pengwern and Glevum, we have separated the #italic Wealas#! of the North and of the West. With their separation, any hope of a united front against us has been all but crushed. \n\nHowever, the remaining kingdoms have not abated in their hostility and continue to raid our border regions from their mountainous redoubts. The only way to stop this is to emulate the Romans, and construct an embankment from sea to sea as what was achieved with Hadrian's Wall."
  BTWK_frontier_event.0001.a:0 "Let us build the ditch."
  BTWK_frontier_event.0001.a_tt_1:0 "A [special_building|E] Slot for the #italic #V $building_type_offas_dyke_01$#!#! will now be available in all provinces belonging to the [GetGeographicalRegion('custom_england_wales_border').GetName]"

  BTWK_frontier_event.0002_desc_other:0 "With [offas_dyke_builder_char.GetName] having asserted [offas_dyke_builder_char.GetHerHis] superiority over the Midlands, [offas_dyke_builder_char.GetSheHe] has divided the northern and western tribes of #italic Wealas#!. While now fractured, they still pose a threat to [offas_dyke_builder_char.GetHerHis] realm through raids on his border settlements. \n\nIn order to mitigate this, [offas_dyke_builder_char.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] has ordered the construction of a great dyke to be built from the Severn to the Dee."
  BTWK_frontier_event.0002_desc_other_vassal:0 "After recent victories over #italic Wealas#! in the Midlands, our liege [offas_dyke_builder_char.GetFirstNameRegnal] has ordered the construction of a great dyke to be built along the Welsh border, stretching from the Severn to the Dee. With its construction, [offas_dyke_builder_char.GetSheHe] hopes that future raiding parties from [GetGeographicalRegion('custom_wales').GetName] will be greatly hampered in their attempts."
  BTWK_frontier_event.0002_desc_welsh_vassal:0 "As a vassal of [offas_dyke_builder_char.GetName], we are sworn to do right by him. However, we also have ancient loyalties to our kin in the British realms. \n\n[offas_dyke_builder_char.GetFirstName] has ordered the construction of a ditch stretching from the Sabrina to the Deva, attempting to divide us from our fellow Britons to the West!"
  BTWK_frontier_event.0002_desc_welsh:0 "Britannia has been fractured once more. Much of the East has been lost to the #italic Sais#!, though the proud spirit of the Britons still resists here in the West. Now, it seems that they wish to make this division permanent, to forever entrench Saxon rule over the lowlands. \n\n[offas_dyke_builder_char.GetName] has ordered the construction of a great dyke from the Sabrina to the Deva, attempting to separate us from our subjugated kin to the East."

  BTWK_frontier_event.0201_desc:0 "The Rome of old has been gone from Britannia for many years. Behind it left great feats of engineering that have been left to crumble and decay, much like its successor rump states on the Isle. One of such constructions was #italic Hadrian's Wall#!. Constructed by the Emperor Hadrian, it stood definitively as the northernmost border of Rome, designed to impede raiders from crossing into Britain's rich heartlands. Without Rome, it served, and still serves, no purpose. There is no border to defend, as our kingdom now spans both north and south of the wall. \n\nAs such, denizens of the region around the wall had begun to repurpose the old stone to improve the infrastructure of their settlements, given that it was so easily accessible. We will follow in their footsteps, using its stone to ease our own construction efforts, bringing the land into a new era."

While the gesture was ultimately symbolic (as the wall no longer marks the northern frontier of Britannia), it is still practically useful as a defensive fortification, should the need ever arise. \n\nThough the effort to rebuild has taken many years, gold and manpower to complete, as the overseer of the final stones being set into place, you are the one the poems shall remember the most. Many among the isle are beginning to praise you as 'Hadrianus', as a successor to the great Emperor Hadrian himself."
