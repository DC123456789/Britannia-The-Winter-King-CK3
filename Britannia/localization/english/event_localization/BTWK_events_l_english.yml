Having taken full control of the formerly Powysian & Gwentish heartlands, we have in doing so isolated by land the #italic Wealas#! of the North and of the South. With their separation, any hope of a united front against us has been all but crushed. \n\nHowever, when left unchecked, they still remain to send raiding parties into our border regions. The only way to stop this is to emulate the Romans, and construct an embankment from sea to sea as what was achieved with Hadrian's Wall."

There was no border to defend - the land split between warring factions. \n\nAs such, denizens of the region around the wall had begun to repurpose the old stone to improve the infrastructure of their settlements, given it was so easily accessible.
