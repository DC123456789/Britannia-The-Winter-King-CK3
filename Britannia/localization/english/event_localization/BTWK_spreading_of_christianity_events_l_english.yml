 spreading_of_christianity.0001.desc.christian: "Praise the Lord and His Saints! While the last few decades have been turbulent indeed, the church has persevered as it always has and the faith has never been stronger. From Ireland to India the hard work of missionaries continues to spread the Word of God to ever more peoples who have not yet had the fortune to hear the good news. \n\nWith every passing day the church grows as more and more worshippers enter the faith, whether it be converts in still-pagan rural areas or entirely new peoples at the frontier of civilization. Surely it is only a matter of time before the whole world comes under the loving bosom of the Lord!"
 spreading_of_christianity.0001.desc.hellenic: "The Christians are spreading like a plague across Europe. Followers of the old religions are becoming fewer and fewer in the cities and larger settlements, and their missionaries are starting to make great strides even in the rural areas where our gods still hold strong. \n\nIf nothing is done, then our ancestral faith will soon be nothing more than a distant memory, an academic curiosity of the old days amidst the triumph of the cross. Can the Galilean tide be stopped? Or is it time to accept the inevitable and embrace the Christian faith as our own?"
 spreading_of_christianity.0001.desc.briton_gaelic: "The Christians are spreading like a plague across Europe. The old gods of the Romans have already largely given way to the singular worship of the Christian god, and it seems that our gods may not be much further behind. Already many chiefs and kings have decided to accept the missionaries and embrace this new religion, allowing them to spread their faith further and further into our heartlands.\n\nIf nothing is done, then our ancestral faith will soon be nothing more than a distant memory, collections of half-remembered tales amidst the triumph of the cross. Can the Christian tide be stopped? Or is it time to accept the inevitable and embrace this new faith as our own?"
 spreading_of_christianity.0001.desc.other_non_christian: "The faith of the Christians is a peculiar one, insisting on the worship of their god to the exclusion of all others and incessantly seeking to spread their faith further and further beyond. While some say that their Christ is a weak and peace-loving god, we would do well not to underestimate the zeal of his followers and the power of his church. \n\nWhile we have seen little in the way of missionary activity so far, it may only be a matter of time before their church turns its sights to us in full force. But perhaps that may not be all that bad - it could also be an opportunity to seek better ties with the rich lands of the south and harness their knowledge and culture for ourselves."
 spreading_of_christianity.0001.a.christian: "Let them hear the good news!"
 spreading_of_christianity.0001.a.hellenic: "This may be the last gasp of the old gods..."
 spreading_of_christianity.0001.a.briton_gaelic: "We must make our choice soon."
 spreading_of_christianity.0001.a.other_non_christian: "We should keep an eye on this."
