 # NOTES ON IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CURRENT SET OF LOCALISATION IN CASE SOMEONE ELSE WANTS TO HAVE A REDRAFT AT A LATER POINT IN TIME (AS I AM NOT A WRITER):
 #    - CHARACTER SPECIFIC EVENTS COULD BE REWRITTEN SOMEWHAT TO REFLECT MORE THE PERSONALITY OF SUCH CHARACTER BETTER:
 #        - I.E. TEWDRIC/ARTHUR ARE HONOURABLE, STRATEGIC, ETC.; UTHER IS OLD, CANTANKEROUS AND CALLOUS; GUNDLEUS IS AMBITIOUS AND TWISTED, ETC.
 #    - LOCALISATION COULD DO WITH APPROPRIATE SCOPING (I.E. TITLES, CHARACTER NAMES) WHERE THERE ISN'T ALREADY
 #    - GRAMMAR MAY BE A BIT CRAP - DONE TOO MUCH OF THIS HYPENATING I THINK, AND MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE EVERYWHERE.

 BTWK_story_event.0101.desc:0 "Your one and only heir is your newborn grandson, Mordred, after your only legitimate son - his namesake - was killed in battle some months prior. The babe's crippled leg - a bad omen - only helps to sow the seeds of discontent. Without sufficient preparation for your death, and his ascension to rule, this surely will spell disaster for Dumnonia. \n\nAs High King of Britannia, you have the power to convene 'High Councils' in times of peril. The last of these was over 80 years ago, but with the threat ever-increasing encroachment by the Saxons, and British warlords forever infighting, you see no other option to bring peace to Britannia once more. Messengers have been sent you would like to meet them in Glevum."

 BTWK_story_event.0102.t:0 "The High Council at Glevum"
 BTWK_story_event.0102.desc:0 "A messenger has delivered a letter bearing the insignia of Dumnonia. Opening it, you read that a High Council is to be held in the old Roman seat of Glevum. Being one of the foremost warlords of Britannia, your presence has been requested at the behest of High King Uther. While the meeting is of course not mandatory, the gathering certainly presents a great opportunity to heal old wounds between your fellow warlords. With the Germanic barbarians amassing their strength on the frontiers of LLoegyr, and the frequency of Irish raids increasing yearly, putting an end to the infighting plaguing Britons is of paramount importance. A missive within the letter particularly sticks out, however - Uther intends to find his newborn heir a foster father, fearing himself not long for this world. Perhaps this is an ideal opportunity to forge an alliance with the breadbasket of Britain herself - the Kingdom of Dumnonia."

 BTWK_story_event.0118.t:0 "The Question of Arthur"
 BTWK_story_event.0118.desc:0 "A skirmish in the Harvest season of 479 between Dumnonian forces and the Saxons concluded in the death of King Uther's only legitimate son and heir, Prince Mordred. However, upon hearing the news, Uther banished Prince Arthur - a bastard child of his - to King Ban's realm in Armorica, blaming the young soldier for his brother's untimely death.\n\n While this arrangement may have proven a boon for the Armorican ruler, the impending council could be the perfect opportunity to petition for Arthur's return. You will leave this task to your trusted Marshall, Comes Agricola, to represent the will of the martial class. Directly announcing your support for the Prince personally will not lend you any favours, least of all with Uther himself.\n\n The High King's hositilities aside, no one can deny Arthur is an exceptional man, soldier, and diplomat. Britannia may have capable men ready to fight for their country to the bitter end, history has taught you such people are doomed to oblivion without a skilled leader to match. Maybe Arthur is the answer?"

 BTWK_story_event.0117.desc:0 "Before the High Council can make head, your liege Tewdric has come with a request. To avoid personally provoking the ire of High King Uther (and possibly even hostile kings of neighbouring realms), he asks you to petition Uther to arrange Prince Arthur's marriage to the Lady Norwenna. The young Prince had been banished by none other than Uther himself, his own father, following the death of the High King's only legitimate son and heir's death. Doing so will ensure that Arthur - a brilliant soldier and leader in his own right - may return to the shores of Britannia once more to aid in her struggle against the invading barbarians.\n\n To avoid risking any suspicion, you are to frame the act as the will of your fellow soldiers - easily done, given Arthur's popularity among them.

A number of guardians have also been named for the Edling Mordred. Chiefly among them is Tewdric, King of Gwent, the legendary druid Merlin, and Uther's own son, the renowned warlord Prince Arthur. Such a web of alliances will surely fortify Dumnonia against its enemies until the young Prince reaches maturity."
 BTWK_story_event.0115.desc_arthur:0 "Word has reached you that, despite the misgivings he holds for his bastard son, a marriage has been arranged between Prince Arthur, and his late brother's widow, Norwenna. With Arthur's arrangment as the Edling Prince's foster father, his return to the shores of Britannia from the Armorican frontlines is imminent. A number of guardians have also been named for the young Mordred. Chiefly among them are Tewdric, King of Gwent, and the legendary druid Merlin. While Uther was unsuccessful in uniting the British warlords towards their continued survival, the impending return of Arthur may be enough to give Dumnonia some pause from the assaults of its enemies - for a time at least."

Chiefly among them is Tewdric, King of Gwent, the legendary druid Merlin, and Uther's own son, the renowned warlord Prince Arthur.
