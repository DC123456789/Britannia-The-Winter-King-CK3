 BTWK_story_event.0101.desc:0 "Your one and only heir is your newborn grandson, Mordred, after your only legitimate son - his namesake - was killed in battle some months prior. The babe's crippled leg - a bad omen - only helps to sow the seeds of discontent. Without sufficient preparation for your death, and his ascension to rule, this surely will spell disaster for Dumnonia. \n\nAs High King of Britannia, you have the power to convene 'High Councils' in times of peril. The last of these was over 80 years ago, but with the threat ever-increasing encroachment by the Saxons, and British warlords forever infighting, you see no other option to bring peace to Britannia once more. Messengers have been sent you would like to meet them in Glevum."

However, thanks to a bout of illness, you have been reduced to shadow of your former self. Managing the realm, something that you would otherwise excel at, has become an impossible task in your newfound fraility.

Later, he found himself as aide to the neighbouring King of Benoic, Ban, defending against the hordes of barbarous Franks. With his father's passing, however, Arthur was obliged to return from Armorica to ensure the stablilty of the realm for his infant nephew, Mordred ap Mordred. Will you fulfil your oath to Uther as Mordred's protector, or instead take #italic other steps# to secure Dumnonia against the inevitable Saxon onslaught?"
