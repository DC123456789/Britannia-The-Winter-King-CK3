 BTWK_story_event.0101.desc:0 "Your one and only heir is your newborn grandson, Mordred, after your only legitimate son - his namesake - was killed in battle some months prior. In the wake of his death, you banished your bastard son Arthur to Armorica, blaming him in grief for the recent misfortune to befall your lineage. The babe's crippled leg - a bad omen - only helps to sow the seeds of discontent. Without sufficient preparation for your death, and his ascension to rule, this surely will spell disaster for Dumnonia. \n\nAs High King of Britannia, you have the power to convene 'High Councils' in times of peril. The last of these was over 80 years ago, but with the threat ever-increasing encroachment by the Saxons, and British warlords forever infighting, you see no other option to bring peace to Britannia once more. Messengers have been sent you would like to meet them in Glevum."

As you are one of Britain's most powerful warlords, he has requested your attendance. Presence at the meeting offers a great opportunity to heal the old wounds between rival realms, giving chances to forge bonds anew. With the Germanic barbarians amassing their strength within the Lost Lands of Lloegyr, and the frequency of Irish raids increasing yearly, putting an end to the infighting plaguing Britons is of paramount importance.\n\n A missive within the letter particularly sticks out however - Uther intends to seek marriage for his late heir's widow, Princess Norwenna. Any unmarried ruler, or his unmarried heir, is an eligible candidate for this arrangement, and will be oathbound in the protection of the Edling Mordred - the new heir presumptive of Dumnonia - till he is of fit age to rule, effectively forming an alliance with Dumnonia"

 BTWK_story_event.0118.desc:0 "A skirmish in the Autumn of 479 between Dumnonian forces and the Saxons concluded in the death of King Uther's only legitimate son and heir, Prince Mordred. However, upon hearing the news, Uther banished his bastard son Arthur to Benoic, blaming the young soldier for his brother's untimely death.\n\n While this arrangement may have proven a boon for the Armorican ruler, the impending council could be the perfect opportunity to petition for Arthur's return. You will leave this task to your trusted Marshal, [GetTitleByKey('c_glevum').GetHolder.GetShortUIName]. Directly announcing your support for the Prince personally will not lend you any favours, least of all with Uther himself.\n\n The High King's hositilities aside, no one can deny Arthur is an exceptional man, soldier, and diplomat. Britannia may have capable men ready to fight for their country to the bitter end, history has taught you such people are doomed to oblivion without a skilled leader to match. Maybe Arthur is the answer?"

To avoid personally provoking the ire of High King Uther (and possibly even hostile kings of neighbouring realms), he asks you to petition Uther to arrange Arthur's marriage to the Lady Norwenna. The young Prince had been banished by none other than Uther himself, his own father, following the death of the High King's only legitimate son and heir's death. Doing so will ensure that Arthur - a brilliant soldier and leader in his own right - may return to the shores of Britannia once more to aid in her struggle against the invading barbarians.\n\n To avoid risking any suspicion, you are to frame the act as the will of your fellow soldiers - easily done, given Arthur's popularity among them.

You let the many lords of Britain in attendance bicker away on who they believe to be the better suitor for Lady Norwenna while you sit in silence, listening. Many a candidate had been suggested, but none were yet to the council's liking. The British kings in Armorica and Hen Ogledd were simply too far from Dumnonia. The remaining fiefdoms in Western Lloegyr, like Stronggore, were half overrun by the Saxons and would certainly be no use in aiding Dumnonia's defence. But then, [agricola.GetShortUIName] spoke the name you dreaded to hear - that of your exiled, bastard son.\n\n 'Arthur', Agricola said. 'I propose Arthur'. \n\n The Dumnonian warriors in the hall rise in applause, but are swiftly quelled as you bring down your spear. Of course, Agricola was acting as King Tewdric's mouthpiece, yet surely Tewdric knew the impossibility of what he asks? While he might be renowned for his martial ability, in your eyes he is nothing but a failed soldier. Why else would he have allowed your late heir, his liege, to die on the battlefield? Furthermore, by having him be wed to Norwenna, you sacrifice any chance you had to secure a new alliance.\n\n While you feel resolute in your decision, you know full well the rejection of your ally's proposition will indebt your to him, and he may make a request of you in the future."
