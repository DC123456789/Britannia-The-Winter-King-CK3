 dlc_BTWK: "The Winter King"
 dlc_BTWK_desc: "The Empire in the West has fallen, but a new order has yet to emerge. Petty warlords scrap over the ruins of Roman Britain, ambitious kings carve out new realms from as far as Gaul and Africa, and new kingdoms rise to prominence beyond the old limes, all while the Church continues its seemingly inexorable spread throughout the known world. Forge new identities or hold to old glories, carve out new kingdoms or protect ancient homelands, and build a new order or restore Imperial rule altogether in The Winter King, a total conversion mod for the post-Roman era of Western Europe."
