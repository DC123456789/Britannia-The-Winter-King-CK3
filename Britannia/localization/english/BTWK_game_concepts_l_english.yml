 game_concept_high_king_britannia_desc: "The greatest and most powerful of the kings of [GetGeographicalRegion('btwk_world_britannia').GetName] can be recognized as High King, a position of ceremonial and military leadership theoretically holding sovereignty over all the other kings of the island. Any sufficient prestigious independent Brythonic or Imperial [king|E] in Britannia can try to claim the title for themselves but will only be generally recognized as High King with the acceptance of all the other British kings, whether by diplomatic agreement or military submission. Rulers that submit to the High King, voluntarily or otherwise, will become [tributaries|E] under their protection and suzerainty, while more distant or uninterested kings - particularly in the North - may choose to recognize the High King's authority in name only and remain independent.\n\nTypically, the High King only holds his title in a personal capacity, and the High Kingship will be lost on succession or if enough of his vassals feel that he is no longer fit to rule. However, a sufficiently powerful High King can attempt to pass reforms to formalize his dynasty's hold on the title, increase his authority over his subject kings, and eventually unite the fragmented British kingdoms back together."
