 game_concept_foederati_desc:0 "Foederati are communities of foreign tribes or settlers employed for military service by Roman or Brythonic [realms|E]. They are represented as [tributaries|E], with their [suzerain|E], or employer, granting them land to settle in exchange for [levies|E] and war support. Foederati will gain [prestige|E] from being employed, as well as an [army|E] maintenance discount, a higher amount of [levies|E] and a larger [garrison|E] in all their [holdings|E]. They may also be granted financial subsidies to their [income|E] if part of their [tributary_contract|E].\n\nUnlike other types of special contracts, Foederati Status can only be granted or revoked by [decision|E] or [character_interaction|E], not through the contract window. Foederati are likely to [revolt|E] if their status is revoked, or if they feel that their overlords are becoming too weak and unable to fulfill their obligations."
