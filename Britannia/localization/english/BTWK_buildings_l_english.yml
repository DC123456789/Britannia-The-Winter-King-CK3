 building_archery_range_01:0 "Field Range"
 building_archery_range_01_desc:0 "By creating a small clearing on the outskirts of the settlement, we can provide our archers space for a suitable training field."
 building_archery_range_02:0 "Rudimentary Shelters"
 building_archery_range_02_desc:0 "Constructing wooden shelters around the shooting bays and targets will allow training to commence even in poor weather."
 building_archery_range_03:0 "Archers' Barracks"
 building_archery_range_03_desc:0 "Providing simple quarters for our men to rest and recuperate will improve morale and allow for longer training sessions."
 building_archery_range_04:0 "Bowyers' Workshops"
 building_archery_range_04_desc:0 "Employing skilled bowyers at the range will ensure our archers are always equipped with high quality bows, and that regular maintenance is performed on them to prevent untimely breakage."
 building_archery_range_05:0 "Fletchers' Workshops"
 building_archery_range_05_desc:0 "Providing the training grounds with its own fletchers should grant the archers a steady supply of arrows, preventing any shortages that might hinder training."
 building_archery_range_06:0 "Range Expansions"
 building_archery_range_06_desc:0 "Further expanding the archery range will boost the capacity of men that can be trained at once, while also providing greater distances at which to shoot, ensuring larger regiments can be trained efficiently."
 building_archery_range_07:0 "Leatherworkers"
 building_archery_range_07_desc:0 "While archers may be stationed well outside the frontline of battle, it wouldn't hurt to afford them a little defence. We should employ leatherworkers to craft bespoke kits of armour, along with durable quivers to store their ammunition."
 building_archery_range_08:0 "Diversified Targets"
 building_archery_range_08_desc:0 "By investing in a wider range of target shapes and sizes, we can better prepare our archers for the multitude of different combat situations they may find themselves in."
 
 building_watermills_04:0 "Industrial Mills"
 building_watermills_04_desc:0 "What started as a simple flour mill, processing mostly grains, now attracts other trades. Sawing wood or marble, powering furnaces, acting like a turbine or cleaning cloths, these mills now fulfill many more tasks than just grinding alone."
 building_watermills_05:0 "Ship Mills"
 building_watermills_05_desc:0 "Barges permanently anchored in the middle of rivers are harnessing the strongest currents. On meandering rivers, barges can be remoored to the outside bends without much effort."
 building_watermills_06:0 "Tide Mills"
 building_watermills_06_desc:0 "Instead of relying on the water currents or the blowing wind, tide mills use the tide to turn their wheel. A dam is created to make a resevoir that captures water when tide is high, and releases it when tide is low, turning the water wheel in the process."
 building_watermills_07:0 "Malt Mills"
 building_watermills_07_desc:0 "Turning grain into malt is a very important step in the process for brewing beer, and having them powered by water rather than men or animals is sure to increase production efficiency."
 building_watermills_08:0 "Levees and Dams"
 building_watermills_08_desc:0 "A set of water levees, dams, and artificial canals, for both undershot and overshot waterwheels, accommodates growing milling needs. With almost every natural suitable spot already occupied, newly-dug waterways are streaking the countryside."

 building_castle_02:1 "Stronghold"
 building_castle_02_desc:1 "Even when the town surrounding it gets overrun, a strengthened stronghold can hold out for weeks, or sometimes even months, keeping the defenders, the holder and the villagers that got away from the onslaught safe."
 building_castle_03:1 "Burg"
 building_castle_03_desc:1 "Burgs are strategically located so that every village, no matter its importance, can easily be protected by the soldiers stationed at the burg. Futhermore, burgs are home to all sorts of artisinal shops and often house a market."
 building_castle_04:1 "Motte"
 building_castle_04_desc:1 "The motte castle consists of a keep built on a mound overseeing the lower laying town. It offers excellent protection from enemy armies, raiders and bandits, who will have to fight an uphill battle if they come to attack it."
 
 building_type_curtain_walls_01:0 "Castle Walls"
 building_type_curtain_walls_01_desc:0 "A castle without its walls is like an archer without his bow. In order to protect the holding, its lord and its people against sieges and raids, a network of palisades or walls and watchtowers are of utmost importance."
 building_curtain_walls_01:0 "Wooden Palisade"
 building_curtain_walls_01_desc:0 "A simple wooden palisade might not be able to fend off the most determined enemies, but it can stop rabble and bandits from getting in the holding."
 building_curtain_walls_02:0 "Reinforced Wooden Palisade"
 building_curtain_walls_02_desc:0 "Reinforcing the palisade will further strengthen this castle's defences, enabling it to fend off stronger attackers."
 building_curtain_walls_03:0 "Stone Walls"
 building_curtain_walls_03_desc:0 "Since stone is much stronger than wood, stone walls offer more protection against the newest siege weapons."
 building_curtain_walls_04:0 "Wall Fortifications"
 building_curtain_walls_04_desc:0 "Battlements can protect any defender of the siege against simple hostile fire and arrowslits give them the chance to fire back without ever being in danger of being hit with an arrow themselves."
 building_curtain_walls_05:0 "Wall Towers"
 building_curtain_walls_05_desc:0 "Integrating towers into the wall gives the defenders several advantages, including having a better oversight over the hostile camp, adding more internal space and being able to divide the walls into several segments."
 building_curtain_walls_06:0 "Higher Walls"
 building_curtain_walls_06_desc:0 "The higher the wall, the harder it is for enemies to scale it and the longer the attacker needs to climb on the ladder, the more time the defender has to push it over."
 building_curtain_walls_07:0 "Inner Wall"
 building_curtain_walls_07_desc:0 "What is better than having one wall? Having two of them. Even when the attackers are able to scale the first wall, they still have to overcome the second one built around the most vital parts of the castle."
 building_curtain_walls_08:0 "Bailey"
 building_curtain_walls_08_desc:0 "Between the inner and outer wall, there is enough space to fit a bailey, where arms and munitions can easily be stored and protected for the duration of the siege."
 
 building_type_palisades_01:0 "Tribal Walls"
 building_type_palisades_01_desc:0 "As hostile forces, raiders and rabble are luring anywhere, building walls around the tribal hold is vital for its prosperity and its people."
 building_palisades_01:0 "Ramparts"
 building_palisades_01_desc:0 "The simplest form of defence for the hold consists of earthen walls, often supplemented with wooden support. These surround the main tribal village and grant at least some form of protection."
 building_palisades_02:0 "Ditches"
 building_palisades_02_desc:0 "Digging a ditch around the rampart provides the hold with extra defense by slowing down the enemy. Additionally, it rarely lets hostile battering rams through."
 building_palisades_03:0 "Wooden Palisade"
 building_palisades_03_desc:0 "On top of the rampart, a simple wooden palisade is erected, enabling the hold's defenders to much more easily fend of small groups of enemies."
 building_palisades_04:0 "Reinforced Wooden Palisade"
 building_palisades_04_desc:0 "The existing wooden palisade is reinforced by tightening the spaces between the stakes and strenthening them with stone and constructions on the inside, making the wall much stronger and more reliable."
 building_palisades_05:0 "Simple Stone Walls"
 building_palisades_05_desc:0 "This wall is built using stones, which are much stronger and much more effective at defending a hold than the wood that palisades are made of."
 building_palisades_06:0 "Improved Stone Walls"
 building_palisades_06_desc:0 "By improving the construction methods, the primitive stone walls can be increased in height and width. The improved methods of laying and bonding stones will also make sure the wall cannot easily be breached."
