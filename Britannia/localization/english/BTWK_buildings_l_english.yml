 #Hill Farms
 building_type_hill_farms_01:0 "Hill Farms"
 building_type_hill_farms_01_desc:0 "The rolling hills of this province stand covered in fields. While farming on a slope helps with keeping crops watered, the limited area means smaller yields."
 building_hill_farms_01:0 "Hillside Fields"
 building_hill_farms_01_desc:0 "Along the sides of the many hills there are numerous small fields, growing crops and sustaining a small peasant population."
 building_hill_farms_02:0 "Earthen Terraces"
 building_hill_farms_02_desc:0 "The steepness of the hills makes farming harder and doesn't allow for the best use of space. By raising earthen terraces, farms can be placed various horizontal strips of land, making the process easier, allowing for higher yield."
 building_hill_farms_03:0 "Cattle Pastures"
 building_hill_farms_03_desc:0 "Cattle are brought to the uncultivated uplands, or fells, and allowed to graze on the plentiful grasses that grow there."

 #Wetland Farms
 building_type_peat_quarries_01:0 "Wetland Farms"
 building_type_peat_quarries_01_desc:0 "While wetlands will never offer the same opportunities for growing crops as plains, it is home to grasses, heath and berries, which makes grazing possible. It also provides peat, an excellent fuel source."
 building_peat_quarries_01:0 "Small Peat Quarries"
 building_peat_quarries_01_desc:0 "The mining of peat has made a humble beginning in this bog. When dried, it makes for an excellent fuel source."
 building_peat_quarries_02:0 "Berry Farms"
 building_peat_quarries_02_desc:0 "Even when the bogs may seem to lack fertility, berries have little problem growing here. After being picked, these berries provide the local peasants and villagers with a little addition to their diet."
 building_peat_quarries_03:0 "Pastures"
 building_peat_quarries_03_desc:0 "The many grasses and heather that grow at the wetlands make for fine grazing lands for cattle, sheep and horses."
 building_peat_quarries_04:0 "Salt Mining"
 building_peat_quarries_04_desc:0 "Because wetlands are covered in usually salt water, they can provide salt if extracted by mining or panning. This much sought-after good is used to preserve food and can even function as a way of payment."
 building_peat_quarries_05:0 "Wetland Forestry"
 building_peat_quarries_05_desc:0 "Even though most parts of the wetlands are dominated by grass, some trees can still grow in it or at its edge. After these trees are felled, their wood can be used for construction or as fuel."
 building_peat_quarries_06:0 "Flax Fields"
 building_peat_quarries_06_desc:0 "Like some other plants, flax thrives in wetlands. This important plant provides fibers and linseed to the villagers, who use it to make cloth, sails and plant oils."
 building_peat_quarries_07:0 "Apiaries"
 building_peat_quarries_07_desc:0 "When the heath and the flowers that grow on the bogs are in bloom, the bees from these apiaries turn their nectar into delicious honey."
 building_peat_quarries_08:0 "Large Peat Quarries"
 building_peat_quarries_08_desc:0 "With the increase of population, peat's importance as a fuel source is starting to rise. Naturally, this causes the peat quarries to expand in size."

 building_farm_estates_03:0 "Farmlands"
 building_farm_estates_03_desc:0 "The owners of the mansion not only control their direct gardens, they own vast swathes of farmlands that surround the mansion. Many peasants are employed to plough fields and sow, reap and grind grain."
 building_farm_estates_04:0 "Granaries"
 building_farm_estates_04_desc:0 "The surplus of grain and other yields are stored in granaries to be used or sold in the future."

 building_farm_estates_06:0 "Fishing Pond"
 building_farm_estates_06_desc:0 "Either formed naturally or with the help of man, a fishing pond is located near the mansion. The caught fish is afterwards preserved through drying and then stored or eaten."
 building_farm_estates_07:0 "Manor Houses"
 building_farm_estates_07_desc:2 "Where was once a mansion, a manor house, home to a lord and lady, can now be found. It stands as the center of a manor, a large piece of land where peasants and serfs work for their lord in the fields."
 building_farm_estates_08:0 "Freeholds"
 building_farm_estates_08_desc:0 "Freeholds are massive, with vast lands surrounding them — as they are passed on in a hereditary fashion, the families they house have ample time to optimize the yield of their lands."

 building_cereal_fields_02:0 "Rotational Farmland"
 building_cereal_fields_02_desc:0 "By splitting the farmlands in two and leaving one half fallow and the other half growing crops and switching every one or two years, the soil will not be depleted, avoiding decreasing yield over the years."
 building_cereal_fields_03:0 "Hamlets"
 building_cereal_fields_03_desc:0 "The construction of more hamlets means that more peasants can be put to work in the fields, increasing the local production and taxation."
 building_cereal_fields_04:0 "Farmsteads"
 building_cereal_fields_04_desc:0 "Larger farmsteads support larger peasant families. When families have space and means to grow, they will generate more children that can be put to toil in the fields."
 building_cereal_fields_05:0 "Granaries"
 building_cereal_fields_05_desc:0 "Granaries allow farmers to store cereals, dried meat, and other types of food throughout the winter. While not immune to mice and other pests, they at least keep their content dry."
 building_cereal_fields_06:0 "Flax Fields"
 building_cereal_fields_06_desc:0 "Flax provides the land with both strong fibers that are used to make textiles and sails, but also with edible linseed, which can be pressed into a healthy oil."
 building_cereal_fields_07:0 "Three-Field Rotation"
 building_cereal_fields_07_desc:0 "Instead of using a system of rotation where half if the fields is left fallow, one is used where only one in three is. This allows for a much higher yield, still without depleting the soil."
 building_cereal_fields_08:0 "Vast Crop Fields"
 building_cereal_fields_08_desc:0 "The advancements in farming allow for expansions of the farmland. From clearing forests en masse to even creating new land from bogs and lakes, farmlands grow far beyond their earlier limits."
