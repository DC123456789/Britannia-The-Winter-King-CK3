 building_type_archery_range_01:0 "Archery Ranges"
 building_type_archery_range_01_desc:0 "Archery ranges allow all walks of life to hone their skills with a bow an arrow, archers themselves providing armies a great ranged advantage on the battlefield."
 building_archery_range_01:0 "Field Range"
 building_archery_range_01_desc:0 "By creating a small clearing on the outskirts of the settlement, we can provide our archers space for a suitable training field."
 building_archery_range_02:0 "Rudimentary Shelters"
 building_archery_range_02_desc:0 "Constructing wooden shelters around the shooting bays and targets will allow training to commence even in poor weather."
 building_archery_range_03:0 "Archers' Barracks"
 building_archery_range_03_desc:0 "Providing simple quarters for our men to rest and recuperate will improve morale and allow for longer training sessions."
 building_archery_range_04:0 "Bowyers' Workshops"
 building_archery_range_04_desc:0 "Employing skilled bowyers at the range will ensure our archers are always equipped with high quality bows, and that regular maintenance is performed on them to prevent untimely breakage."
 building_archery_range_05:0 "Fletchers' Workshops"
 building_archery_range_05_desc:0 "Providing the training grounds with its own fletchers should grant the archers a steady supply of arrows, preventing any shortages that might hinder training."
 building_archery_range_06:0 "Range Expansions"
 building_archery_range_06_desc:0 "Further expanding the archery range will boost the capacity of men that can be trained at once, while also providing greater distances at which to shoot, ensuring larger regiments can be trained efficiently."
 building_archery_range_07:0 "Leatherworkers"
 building_archery_range_07_desc:0 "While archers may be stationed well outside the frontline of battle, it wouldn't hurt to afford them a little defence. We should employ leatherworkers to craft bespoke kits of armour, along with durable quivers to store their ammunition."
 building_archery_range_08:0 "Diversified Targets"
 building_archery_range_08_desc:0 "By investing in a wider range of target shapes and sizes, we can better prepare our archers for the multitude of different combat situations they may find themselves in."

 building_btwk_mines_01:0 "Small Mining Community"
 building_btwk_mines_01_desc:0 "Settlers have established a small community around a mineral rich area, intent to extract its valuable resources. This is mostly achieved by searching for small deposits above ground, like in bogs or streams, with minor excavation work being held to acquire the ore underground."
 building_btwk_mines_02:0 "Surface Excavations"
 building_btwk_mines_02_desc:0 "With the exhaustion of naturally occurring nodules on the surface, greater efforts have been spent to clear the land and expose the rich minerals bedded beneath. This has lead to the construction of a small mine shaft."
 building_btwk_mines_03:0 "Support Structures"
 building_btwk_mines_03_desc:0 "Before the shaft can be expanded further, measures must be put in place to prevent its future in-collapse, such as lining our tunnels regularly with wood and stone, and ensuring that the groundwater is regularly drained out." 
 building_btwk_mines_04:0 "Deeper Shafts"
 building_btwk_mines_04_desc:0 "To access the minerals deeper underground, we must employ the practice of #italic shaft sinking#! - vertically (or near-vertically) deepening a mine shaft, to gain better access to deeply bedded minerals. The excavation work this entails is incredibly dangerous due to the risk of the shaft collapsing and as such is typically tasked to slaves and criminals."

 # For each, research how each was mined (doesn't matter if duplicate entries if they were acquired the same way; salt likely to be unique)
 building_type_btwk_salt_mines_01:0 "Salt Fields"
 building_type_btwk_salt_mines_01_desc:0 "Salt's ability to preserve perishable foods - particularly meat - makes it an incredibly valuable resource in a way unique against the typically mined for metals. [something about presence in province/terrain type & how it's farmed/mined]"

 building_type_btwk_lead_mines_01_desc:0 "Lead's malleability allows for the easy manipulation into constructs like pipes, and was thus essential for maintaining Rome's irrigation infrastructure. While not as important now [try and tie in WRE collapse & the loss of skilled artisans], it still has its use in various construction works."
