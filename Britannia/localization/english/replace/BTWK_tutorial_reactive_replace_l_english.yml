To avoid this penalty, you should consolidate your vassals.\n\nThe best way to do this is by granting [duchies|E] to your vassals, this will make them rule a larger area so that you don't have to! Though for this to work you must yourself hold a [kingdom|E] or a [empire|E], do not make the mistake of giving away one of your [primary_titles|E]!\n\nIf you find yourself exceeding the Vassal Limit as a $game_concept_duke$, we suggest that you form a $game_concept_kingdom$ as soon as you can.#!"

If so, open the Current Situation view, and see if there's one you can create. \n\nIf you're a [vassal|E] and your [liege|E] is a $game_concept_king$, you have to demand independence before you can become a $game_concept_king$ yourself. The first step is to either join or start an [independence_faction|E].#!"

 reactive_advice_county_control_desc:2 "One of your [counties|E] has low [control|E], which means that you'll get reduced [taxes|E] and [levies|E] from it. However, there are ways to increase Control again!\n\n#TUT There are many places you can see Control: in the Domain tab in the Realm View, in the Current Situation view, and in the County view.\n\nTo increase control, you want to go to your Council view and assign your [marshal|E] to the [increase_control|E] task. Control also increases with time, but this process is very slow — we recommend that you use a highly-skilled Marshal instead.\n\nIf you leave a County with low Control for a long time, it may gain [county_corruption|E]. To avoid this, we recommend that you do not conquer too much land in one go.#!"


 reactive_advice_rightful_liege_desc:1 "You're not the [rightful_liege|E] of a [vassal|E].

A [county|E]-tier Vassal wants to be under their De Jure [duchy|E]. For example, the $game_concept_count$ of $c_avalon$ wants to be under the $game_concept_duke$ of $d_avalon$.\n\nIt is very common to have some Vassals that you are #emphasis not#! the Rightful Liege of — there's not much you can do about this, and it's completely normal! However, remember to use the #TUT_KW $grant_vassal_interaction$#! [interaction|E] to organize your Vassals, you can't hold every title by yourself.#!"
 reactive_advice_rightful_liege_2_desc:0 "When conquering new lands you'll often get new Vassals of which you're not the Rightful Liege. Planning your conquests properly can mitigate this problem.\n\n#TUT To avoid having too many Vassals that dislike you, we recommend that you try to focus your conquests within one De Jure area at a time. That way you can #emphasis eventually#! become their Rightful Liege.
