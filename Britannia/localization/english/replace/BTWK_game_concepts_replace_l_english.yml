Since the $game_concept_king$ is neither $game_concept_duke$ of $d_baddon$, $game_concept_king$ of $k_glevum$, nor $game_concept_emperor$ of $e_britannia$, the $game_concept_count$ of $c_abona$ only contributes a tiny amount of their taxes and levies.\n\nThe $game_concept_count$ of $c_avalon$ is also a direct vassal of the $game_concept_king$ of $k_dumnonia$. The $game_concept_king$ does not hold the $game_concept_duchy$ of $d_avalon$, so the $game_concept_count$ also contributes reduced taxes and levies. However, because $k_dumnonia$ is the De Jure $game_concept_kingdom$ of $c_avalon$, the $game_concept_count$ of $c_avalon$ still contributes significantly more tax and levies to the $game_concept_king$ than the $game_concept_count$ of $c_abona$ does.#!"

In its place is a system in which the creation of [titles|E] by [independent|E] [rulers|E] may be restricted based on their [culture|E].

 game_concept_de_jure_drift_desc_part_1_1:0 "A change in the de jure configuration usually occurs in one of three ways: \n• A [titular_title|E] that is part of the new de jure configuration, usually a [duchy|E], is [created|E] by a ruler of a certain [heritage|E] or $game_concept_heritage_group$. The newly created title will instantly gain de jure territory and usually come under a new [kingdom|E] and [empire|E].\n• All the important [counties|E] of a [duchy|E] are controlled by rulers of a certain [heritage|E] or $game_concept_heritage_group$.

 game_concept_de_jure_drift_desc_part_1_2:0 "If all [counties|E] in a former $game_concept_duchy$ are de jure transferred elsewhere, the old title is destroyed and becomes a [titular_title|E].
