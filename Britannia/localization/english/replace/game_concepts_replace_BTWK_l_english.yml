In its place is a system in which the creation of [titles|E] by [independent|E] [rulers|E] may be restricted based on their [culture|E]. In many instances, different heritage groups will have differing de jure configurations in the same region.\n\n"
 game_concept_de_jure_drift_desc_part_1_1:0 "A change in the de jure configuration is usually in one of three ways: \n• A [titular_title|E] that is part of the new de jure configuration, usually a [duchy|E], is created through a [decision|E] by a ruler of a certain [heritage|E] or $game_concept_heritage_group$. The newly created title will instantly gain de jure territory and usually come under a new [kingdom|E] and [empire|E].\n• All the important [counties|E] of a [duchy|E] are controlled by rulers of a certain [heritage|E] or $game_concept_heritage_group$, who can then abolish it through a [decision|E]. This will typically rearrange the [duchy|E] setup for all [counties|E] under the former [duchy|E] and place them under a new [kingdom|E] and [empire|E].\n• All the important [counties|E] of a region are controlled by rulers of a certain [heritage|E] or $game_concept_heritage_group$, who can then integrate the region by [decision|E]. This typically results in no change to the [duchy|E] setup, but will place the [duchies|E] in the region under a new [kingdom|E] and [empire|E].\n\nMany special events and decisions will also adjust the de jure setup.\n\n"
 game_concept_de_jure_drift_desc_part_1_2:0 "If all [counties|E] in a former $game_concept_duchy$ are de jure transferred elsewhere, the old title is destroyed and becomes a [titular_title|E]. Conversely, reconquest of the $game_concept_counties$ that triggered the initial shift will usually allow for the restoration of the old de jure configuration.\n\nTriggering De Jure Shifts that change the De Jure liege of [counties|E] to be under a title you can [create|E] may sometimes be the only way to remove the [rightful_liege|E] penalty."

##################### VASSALAGE #####################

 game_concept_rightful_liege_desc_part2:0 "#weak Example: The $game_concept_count$ of $c_abona$ is a direct vassal of the $game_concept_king$ of $k_dumnonia$. Since the $game_concept_king$ is neither $game_concept_duke$ of $d_baddon$, $game_concept_king$ of $k_glevum$, nor $game_concept_emperor$ of $e_britannia$, the $game_concept_count$ of $c_abona$ only contributes a tiny amount of their taxes and levies.\n\nThe $game_concept_count$ of $c_avalon$ is also a direct vassal of the $game_concept_king$ of $k_dumnonia$. The $game_concept_king$ does not hold the $game_concept_duchy$ of $d_avalon$, so the $game_concept_count$ also contributes reduced taxes and levies. However, because $k_dumnonia$ is the De Jure $game_concept_kingdom$ of $c_avalon$, the $game_concept_count$ of $c_avalon$ still contributes significantly more tax and levies to the $game_concept_king$ than the $game_concept_count$ of $c_abona$ does.#!"

Rulers of a Hybrid culture [promote_culture|E] much faster in Counties of its parent cultures for #V [EmptyScope.ScriptValue('culture_hybrid_cooldown')|0]#! years after it forms.\n\nNew Cultures can also appear as a [divergent_culture|E].#high \n\nIn #italic Britannia - The Winter King#!, the $game_concept_heritage$ of a $game_concept_hybrid_culture$ will always match the $game_concept_culture$ of the ruler who created it, except when forming a new [GetCulturePillar('heritage_romance').GetName] culture."
