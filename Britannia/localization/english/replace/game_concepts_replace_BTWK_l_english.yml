 game_concept_title_desc: "A $game_concept_title$ is essentially a certificate of land ownership.\n\nThe smallest unit of land on the map is the [barony|E]. Baronies are organized into larger areas called [counties|E]. Pagi [de_jure|E] belong to a [duchy|E], counties to a [kingdom|E], and Kingdoms to an [empire|E].\n\n$game_concept_duchies$, $game_concept_kingdoms$ and $game_concept_empires$ do not always have a [holder|E], but are Titles that can be [created|E] by a ruler who controls enough of the corresponding territory.#high \n\nIn #italic Britannia - The Winter King#!, the system by which titles can be created is now restricted and controlled by rulers' cultures. See [de_jure_drift|E] for more details.#!"

 game_concept_de_jure_desc: "Most [titles|E] of are considered part of a higher-Tier Title $game_concept_de_jure$ ('by law').\n\nFor example, a [ruler|E] may be [king|E] of Dumnonia, but their [realm|E] does not yet contain all the lands that are legally considered to be part of Dumnonia.\n\nThe [holder|E] of a [duchy|E], [kingdom|E], or [empire|E] always has a [casus_belli|E] to seize control of its $game_concept_de_jure$ constituent titles.\n\n[vassals|E] will also decide who their [rightful_liege|E] is based on what Title their [primary_title|E] is De Jure a part of."

 game_concept_de_jure_drift_desc_part_1_0: "In #italic Britannia - The Winter King#!, natural De Jure Drift has been completely removed. In its place is a system in which the creation of [titles|E] by [independent|E] [rulers|E] may be restricted based on their [culture|E]. In many instances, different heritage groups will have differing de jure configurations in the same region.\n\n"
 game_concept_de_jure_drift_desc_part_1_1: "A change in the de jure configuration is usually in one of three ways: \n• A [titular_title|E] that is part of the new de jure configuration, usually a [duchy|E], is created through a [decision|E] by a ruler of a certain [heritage|E] or $game_concept_heritage_group$. The newly created title will instantly gain de jure territory and usually come under a new [kingdom|E] and [empire|E].\n• All the important [counties|E] of a [duchy|E] are controlled by rulers of a certain [heritage|E] or $game_concept_heritage_group$, who can then abolish it through a [decision|E]. This will typically rearrange the [duchy|E] setup for all [counties|E] under the former [duchy|E] and place them under a new [kingdom|E] and [empire|E].\n• All the important [counties|E] of a region are controlled by rulers of a certain [heritage|E] or $game_concept_heritage_group$, who can then integrate the region by [decision|E]. This typically results in no change to the [duchy|E] setup, but will place the [duchies|E] in the region under a new [kingdom|E] and [empire|E].\n\nMany special events and decisions will also adjust the de jure setup.\n\n"
 game_concept_de_jure_drift_desc_part_1_2: "If all [counties|E] in a former $game_concept_duchy$ are de jure transferred elsewhere, the old title is destroyed and becomes a [titular_title|E]. Conversely, reconquest of the $game_concept_counties$ that triggered the initial shift will usually allow for the restoration of the old de jure configuration.\n\nTriggering De Jure Shifts that change the De Jure liege of [counties|E] to be under a title you can [create|E] may sometimes be the only way to remove the [rightful_liege|E] penalty."

##################### VASSALAGE #####################

 game_concept_rightful_liege_desc_part2: "#weak Example: The $game_concept_count$ of $c_abona$ is a direct vassal of the $game_concept_king$ of $k_dumnonia$. Since the $game_concept_king$ is neither $game_concept_duke$ of $d_baddon$, $game_concept_king$ of $k_glevum$, nor $game_concept_emperor$ of $e_britannia$, the $game_concept_count$ of $c_abona$ only contributes a tiny amount of their taxes and levies.\n\nThe $game_concept_count$ of $c_avalon$ is also a direct vassal of the $game_concept_king$ of $k_dumnonia$. The $game_concept_king$ does not hold the $game_concept_duchy$ of $d_avalon$, so the $game_concept_count$ also contributes reduced taxes and levies. However, because $k_dumnonia$ is the De Jure $game_concept_kingdom$ of $c_avalon$, the $game_concept_count$ of $c_avalon$ still contributes significantly more tax and levies to the $game_concept_king$ than the $game_concept_count$ of $c_abona$ does.#!"

 game_concept_county_control_desc: "$game_concept_county_control$ measures the grip that the government has on the population of a [county|E]. It is crucial especially for collecting [taxes|E] from the [holdings|E].\n\nWhen a $game_concept_county$ changes hands through [war|E], Control goes down drastically, which is a good reason to vassalize the current [holder|E] instead (if the [casus_belli|E] allows). $game_concept_county_control$ can also be damaged by [sieges|E] and [Concept( 'peasant_faction', 'Peasant Uprisings' )|E].\n\nLow Control may lead to [county_corruption|E], and the primary way of increasing Control is a [councillor_task|E] available to your [marshal|E]."

Rulers of a Hybrid culture [promote_culture|E] much faster in Counties of its parent cultures for #V [EmptyScope.ScriptValue('culture_hybrid_cooldown')|0]#! years after it forms.\n\nNew Cultures can also appear as a [divergent_culture|E].#high \n\nIn #italic Britannia - The Winter King#!, the $game_concept_heritage$ of a $game_concept_hybrid_culture$ will always match the $game_concept_culture$ of the ruler who created it, except when forming a new [GetCulturePillar('heritage_romance').GetName] culture."
