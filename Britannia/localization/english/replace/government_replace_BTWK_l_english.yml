 feudal_government_desc: "\n$game_concept_feudal_desc$\n\n#F Patrinomial governments typically emerge from the loss of central authority in more centralized systems as landowners and officials secure hereditary rights and autonomy over their lands. In a patrinomial system, the rulers who hold the land appoint vassals which are given hereditary fiefs to govern. In return, the vassals provide their liege with [soldiers|E] and [taxes|E].#!"
