 start_year_479_12_03_desc:0 "December 3rd, 479 AD. On a cold winter night, a clubfooted child is born in Durnovaria. His name is Mordred, son of Mordred, and he is the only legitimate heir of King Uther Pendragon of Dumnonia. In the continent, the Roman Empire has just collapsed, but its political and military presence was withdrawn from the island of Britain almost 70 years before. The resulting vacuum was promptly filled by tribes of Anglo-Saxons coming from northern Germany, who are now competing for land and power with the kingdoms of southern Britain, and still landing in great numbers on what is known as "The Anglo Saxon Shore". The northern kingdoms of Britain are plagued by constant raiding warbands of Picts and Scots from the north, while the coastal provinces of Wales are stormed by Irish raiders who declare themselves kings in the conquered lands."
