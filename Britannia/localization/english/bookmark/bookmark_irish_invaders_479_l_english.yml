 bm_479_irish_invaders_desc:0 "While the east of Britannia is plagued by the invading Saxons, the western kingdoms are also struggling. Since the 4th century Irish tribes like the Déisi and the Uí Liathain have set their eyes across the Irish sea, raiding and settling the beleagured coastal kingdoms. By 479, the former British kingdoms of Demetia and Brycheiniog are dominated by Irish settlers, while Diwrnach, King of Lleyn, strikes fear across the western coasts."

As much as he is feared now, he has made many enemies and in the long term will find it difficult to survive against the hostile British kings without a change in approach."

Two generations later, his grandson Oengus and his band of Blackshields have become infamous for their raids of the neighbouring realms."

Surrounded by stronger kingdoms with the threat of the Irish not yet fully abated, Usai's main task will be maintaining the integrity of his realm in the face of those seeking to subjugate or conquer it."

The father of a large number of equally pious children, it has been his family's mission to spread the true faith to Dumnonia and beyond."

 #Cadwallon of Gwynedd

With the foundations of Gwynedd laid, Cadwallon will seek to destroy the remaining Irish kingdoms and carefully manage the many subkings to consolidate his kingdom into what could become the strongest power in the region."
