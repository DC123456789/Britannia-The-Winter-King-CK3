 bm_479_sons_of_wodan_desc:0 "The expulsion of Roman officials from Britannia in the year 410 saw the collapse of central authority, with local officials and opportunistic warlords taking control of its now divided cities. Amongst the disorder, some of the foederati settled along the Saxon Shore - "barbarian" mercenaries given land in return for military service - took the opportunity to seize power, while even those that remained loyal see their influence increasing as more and more settlers arrive. The most ambitious of them all seek to found great kingdoms worthy of a son of Wodan, dreaming of a day when their descendants might rule the whole island - not of $e_britannia$, but of $e_aengland$."

 bookmark_sons_of_wodan_esc_wihtaing_desc:0 "Œsċ, King of the Cantwaras, is the heir of Hengist and Horsa, the great Jutish heroes who brought their people to Britannia and led the Anglo-Saxons in their great revolt against the Britons. He currently owes fealty to the King of Sussex, but the proud Jutes of Kent are eager to restore their independence and reclaim their status as the first and greatest of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms."

 #Trygil Casering

 bookmark_sons_of_wodan_trygil_casering_desc:0 "From his seat in Rendeleshām, Tryġil rules the Sūþfolc, the southernmost of the two peoples found in Ēastengle as opposed to the Norþfolc. He is currently subject to the powerful King Aelle, but it may only be a matter of time before the Anglian hegemony fails. It falls to the Caserings to properly unite the East Angles under their rule and found the great dynasty of the Wuffingas."

 #Bedca Seaxneating

 bookmark_sons_of_wodan_bedca_seaxneating_desc:0 "The men of Essex are proud of their specifically Saxon roots, claiming descent from their national god Seaxneat rather than directly from Wodan. Far from stymying their ambitions, Bedca is as eager as any other leader to found a kingdom of his own. From their current settlements along the coast, the East Saxons will seek to expand their control over the whole region until they are overlord over all of the lower Thames, and perhaps beyond."

 #Esla Ġewisse

 bookmark_sons_of_wodan_esla_gewissae_desc:0 "Esla, son of Ġewis, carries on his father's legacy as leader of the Ġewisse, settled in the upper Thames. With close ties to the Britons around them, the Gewisse have remained largely loyal to their overlords and Esla mostly seeks to preserve his rule amongst the jostling of much larger and stronger powers. Perhaps it will have to be up to his grandson Ċerdiċ to carve out a realm of his own and bring the West Saxons to greatness."

 #Winta Winting

 bookmark_sons_of_wodan_winta_winting_desc:0 "Winta and his ancestors were tasked with guarding the old provincial capital of Lindum, a post they have held to long after the collapse of the administration and the rebellion of many of their fellow foederati. Even as they remain loyal, their influence over the Kingdom of Linnius continues to grow as British power wanes across the island. It may only be a matter of time before Linnius becomes an Angle kingdom in all but name, and perhaps that too."

 bookmark_sons_of_wodan_seomil_wegdeging_desc:0 "The Angles of Deira, lead by Seomil of the Wegdegings, continue to serve the Kingdom of Ebrauc as foederati as they have for many years, defending the kingdom against Pictish raids and foreign predations. Their loyalty is untested for now, but should Seomil or his descendants be tempted by the riches and lands of their suzerains, they would certainly be a force to be reckoned with."
