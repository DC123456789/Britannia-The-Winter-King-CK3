 bm_479_the_winter_king_desc:0 "December 3rd, 479 AD. On a cold winter night, a clubfooted child is born in Durnovaria. His name is Mordred, son of Mordred, and he is the only legitimate heir of King Uther Pendragon of Dumnonia. In the continent, the Roman Empire has just collapsed, but its political and military presence was withdrawn from the island of Britain almost 70 years before. The resulting vacuum was promptly filled by tribes of Anglo-Saxons coming from northern Germany, who are now competing for land and power with the kingdoms of southern Britain, and still landing in great numbers on what is known as "The Anglo Saxon Shore". The northern kingdoms of Britain are plagued by constant raiding warbands of Picts and Scots from the north, while the coastal provinces of Wales are stormed by Irish raiders who declare themselves kings in the conquered lands."

 bookmark_the_winter_king_uther_pendragon_desc:0 "Uther Pendragon, once an icon of strength and leadership, is now a weakened old fool living away his final weeks as sickness slowly overcomes him. His only legitimate son, Mordred, has died fighting the Saxons in Lloegyr, and Uther now lingers before the grave in the knowledge that his kingdom and legacy will be continued by a clubfooted infant - his grandson known also as Mordred. Uther's estranged bastard son campaigns in Armorica, and should Uther neither survive nor make peace with Arthur then his realm may be plunged into a conflict that could cost it dearly in the endless struggle for Britain."

Banished from Dumnonia after the death of Uther's only legitimate son, Mordred, in battle, Arthur now serves in the court of his brother-in-law, King Budic of Broceliande. With his father ailing, however, Arthur will soon have to return from Armorica to serve as regent to his infant nephew, Mordred ap Mordred, and must either hold together his nephew's realm, or take other steps to secure it against the inevitable Saxon onslaught."

Having embraced the Christian faith of the continent, Tewdric would prefer to spread the word of Christ to lifting a sword, even if this is at the expense of his allies and his people."

Though his intentions are neither especially good nor malicious, Gorfyddyd cares more for his Kingdom and his legacy than for the feelings and lives of others. Desperate to marry his daughter Ceinwyn, the Star of Powys and one of the most beautiful women in Britain, Gorfyddyd is surely a ripe target for many as an ally, or indeed someone who could easily become an enemy."

 bookmark_the_winter_king_king_aelle_desc:0 "Bretwalda is what they are calling him, though the title is perhaps premature. Aelle of Anglia is a mighty warlord of the Angles who has already made a name for himself in the distant land of Angeln - home of these rough foreigners. Claiming to be the King of all Britain, Aelle seeks to make his dream a reality in the face of competition from the bloodthirsty Cerdic and the valiant Britons."

 bookmark_the_winter_king_king_cerdic_desc:0 "Ċerdiċ the Black is perhaps the most terrifying of all the Saxons who have ever set foot on Britain's shores. Having systematically destroyed the Britons of Ceint and Rhegin, Ċerdiċ has consolidated his control over all the Anglo-Saxons south of the Thames and has now turned his envious gaze solely on Dumnonia, his raids penetrating far enough as to threaten every Briton from the borderlands to the Severn."
