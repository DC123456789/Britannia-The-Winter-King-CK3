# RUMOUR OF A PLAGUE
poj_event.0101.t:0 "A Plague in the Empire."
poj_event.0101.desc:0 "With the realm reeling from the harsh winters, holding councils regularly to allocate the now sparse food stockpiles have been imperative. On this particular occasion, it is brought to your attention that a deadly pestilence has been reported as spreading through the Eastern Roman Empire. They say those unfortunate enought to contract the illness develop terribly painful buboes across the entirety of their body, which leave a festering, oozing wound when opened. \n\nThe critics of the Eastern Roman Emperor have named the plague after him. They call it the 'Plague of Justinian.' "

poj_event.0101.a_cynical:0 "As if! Nothing more than rumours spread by charlatans!"
poj_event.0101.a_zealous_abrahamic:0 "We must pray that it does not reach our lands."

# THE PLAGUE HAS HIT
poj_event.0102.t:0 "The Plague of Justinian Arrives."
poj_event.0102.desc:0 "The dreaded pestilence known as the 'Plague of Justinian', which has ravaged the populace of the Eastern Roman Empire in the last few years, has finally reached Britannia. It was rumoured to have reared itself in the Roman province of Egypt, soon spreading to the Empire's illustirious capital Constantinople, reportedly killing almost half of the city's inhabitants in only a few months.\n\nUnfortunately, it does not seem we will be spared. Where the plague spreads, an air of death is left in its wake. Villages are decimated, their wells left tainted - surely a curse being laid upon the land by the baleful dead. With a certainty, the coming months will only grow darker as both disease and starvation grip the realm."

poj_event.0102.desc_christian:0 "\n\nThe world is ailing, from famine and war, from plague and death. There are cries among the zealous that the Four Horsemen have finally come to bring about the Day of Judgement." 

poj_event.0102.a_standard:0 "This is troubling news, but nothing can be done."
poj_event.0102.a_cynical_christian:0 "The holy men have been wrong before. This will surely pass."
poj_event.0102.a_zealous_pagan:0 "The curse of the Gods is upon us! We shall offer a great sacrifice!"
poj_event.0102.a_zealous_abrahamic:0 "This is the wrath of God! Sinners and pagans will be doomed!"
