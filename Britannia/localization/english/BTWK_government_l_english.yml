 imperial_government_desc:0 "$game_concept_imperial_desc$\n\n#F Imperial Government is a bureaucratic and rigidly organised system of governance employed by the Roman Empire its remnant territories. Imperial rulers rely on a expensive bureaucracy to administer the realm and draw less of their military forces from levies, instead relying on the highly organized and disciplined - though costly - legions. Under the Imperial system, the civil and military administration are completely seperate, with governors serving as administrators without any official military commands and the legions under a seperate army structure ultimately answerable only to the Imperator. The loyalty of the army and bureaucracy depends in part on the consistency of pay, and an emperor that runs into a financial crisis may find their authority quickly erode away.#!"

 legion_government_desc:0 "The Roman legions were emblematic of the organization and discipline of the Roman Empire in its heyday, and as elite heavy infantry of the Roman army form the backbone of the Imperial army. Under Imperial governments, the legions represent the military as fully distinct from the civil administration. Only legionary commanders are allowed to be marshal and command armies apart from the Imperator and the Caesar, and each commander is tied to his respective legion under his liege while barred from holding other titles while in command. Legions that have lost their legionary base and are annihilated in battle will be destroyed, but a Roman Emperor that manages to reconquer a legion's base and area can restore them by decision."
